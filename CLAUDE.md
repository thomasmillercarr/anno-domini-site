# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

The marketing site for **"Anno Domini — A Fractional AI Partner"** has been **built out in full** as
an **Astro site under [`web/`](web/)**. That is the canonical, deployable implementation — it is what
you edit.

The [`agency-wireframe/`](agency-wireframe/) folder is the **original Claude Design export** the build
came from. Treat it as **historical reference** — design intent, brand notes, and source assets — not
the build target. Do **not** edit the prototype HTML/CSS/JS to change the live site; those files no
longer drive anything. (See "Historical reference" at the bottom.)

If a request is ambiguous about *which* layer to touch (live Astro build vs. the old export) or about
scope, ask before implementing.

## Build & run

Real build system — run everything from inside [`web/`](web/):

- `npm install` — install dependencies
- `npm run dev` — Astro dev server (`astro dev`)
- `npm run build` — static build (`astro build`)
- `npm run preview` — preview the built output

Stack: **Astro 5**, `output: 'static'` (see [web/astro.config.mjs](web/astro.config.mjs)), `site:
'https://os.partners'`. Deploys to **Vercel** (auto-detected, no adapter needed while output stays
static). Runtime deps: `gsap` (animation) and `lenis` (smooth scroll). There is no test suite or lint
config.

## Project structure (`web/src/`)

- [`pages/index.astro`](web/src/pages/index.astro) — the single page; composes the section components
  in order: Nav → Hero → Manifesto → Problem → Solution → BuildMenu → HowItWorks → Ladder → Proof →
  CTA → Footer → Booker (the Booker contact panel renders last, outside the page flow).
- [`pages/privacy.astro`](web/src/pages/privacy.astro) — the UK GDPR privacy notice at `/privacy`,
  footer-linked and sharing `Base.astro` + the Booker panel (still a draft — see pre-launch note below).
- [`layouts/Base.astro`](web/src/layouts/Base.astro) — `<html>`/`<head>` shell: meta/OG/canonical, a
  **font preload** for the subset Archivo woff2 (self-hosted, so there is no preconnect), a
  **no-FOUC inline script** (restores `localStorage['os-theme']` and
  sets `html.motion` before paint — this is the single gate for the whole motion layer), and the
  client scripts, deferred to `requestIdleCallback`.
- [`data/site.ts`](web/src/data/site.ts) — **single source of truth for all copy.** Every component
  reads from the exported `site` object; nothing is hard-coded in markup. To change wording, edit this
  file only.
- [`styles/os-site.css`](web/src/styles/os-site.css) — the entire design system (tokens, type roles,
  layout helpers, component styles). Originally ported 1:1 from the prototype; it has since gained the
  self-hosted `@font-face` block, the motion layer, press states, and the reduced-motion /
  high-contrast blocks.
- `scripts/` — client behaviour, bundled and imported by `Base.astro`: `theme.ts` (dark-mode toggle
  persisted to `os-theme`, **plus the nav `.scrolled` / `.on-hero` states**, driven by two
  `IntersectionObserver` sentinels rather than a scroll listener), `scroll.ts` (Lenis smooth scroll and
  smooth in-page anchors; exposes `window.__lenis` for scroll-lock), `statcard.ts` (hero stat counter),
  `pointer.ts` (magnetic cursor / parallax; also exports the shared `rafThrottle`), `reveal.ts`
  (scroll-linked entrance choreography, gated on `html.motion`), `herofield.ts` (the generated hero
  backdrop — see below), `booker.ts` (the GSAP-Flip contact panel + Web3Forms submit). See the
  motion-layer notes for the `html.motion` gating pattern.
- `components/` — one `.astro` per section, each importing `site` for its copy.

## Content lives in `site.ts`

[`web/src/data/site.ts`](web/src/data/site.ts) is the only file to touch for copy.

The copy is **written and coherent** — it is no longer the wireframe's placeholder text. It is written
against `WEBSITE-COPY-SOURCE.md` (the offer), and that document's §0 voice rules apply to every string
in the file: British English, no exclamation marks, no em/en dashes used as a pause (commas or full
stops instead; hyphenated compounds are fine), understated, the catch stated rather than hidden.
Match that voice when editing.

The ladder is **Founding Build → The Audit → The Retainer** under the heading "Three ways in", and the
CTA is the soft "Start a conversation". The wireframe's recruitment-oriented sections and its
transactional CTA were rewritten out some time ago; if you find a description of them anywhere, it is
stale.

## Design system (`web/src/styles/os-site.css`)

The whole visual system is token-driven from `:root`. Style against the **semantic** tokens, never raw
palette, so theming holds:

- **Theming**: light is default (`<html data-theme="light">`). `[data-theme="dark"]` overrides the
  same semantic tokens. `scripts/theme.ts` flips `data-theme` and persists to `localStorage['os-theme']`;
  `Base.astro`'s inline script restores it before paint. Semantic tokens (`--ground`, `--surface`,
  `--ink`, `--ink-soft`, `--ink-mute`, `--accent`, `--accent-warm`, `--support`, `--frost-*`,
  `--on-img`/`--on-img-mute`) reference raw palette tokens (`--bone`, `--linen`, `--sand`, `--timber`,
  `--clay`, `--sage`, `--charcoal`).
- **Motion**: one easing token, `--ease` (`cubic-bezier(.22, 1, .36, 1)`, a quintic decelerate). Every
  transition and keyframe uses it; durations stay per-component. Do not reintroduce the bare `ease`
  keyword — it is ease-in-out, and mixing the two is what made transitions meant to match visibly
  differ. The one deliberate exception is the statcard's 1100ms line draw.
- **Press**: `:active` states live in one block near the `:focus-visible` rules. They ride the
  independent `scale` property, never `transform`, so they compose with the magnetic translate on
  `.btn`. Press-in is 90ms against the slower hover ease; the release settles on the base duration.
- **Typography**: a single variable font, **Archivo**, **self-hosted** from `web/public/fonts/` via the
  `@font-face` block at the top of `os-site.css` (subset by `scripts/subset-fonts.py`; preloaded in
  `Base.astro`, no third-party round-trip). The design leans hard on variable-font axes —
  `font-variation-settings` sets width (`wdth` 62–125) and weight (`wght`) per type role (`.display`,
  `.display-xl`, `.label`, `.body`, `.lede`, etc.). Preserve the exact axis values; they carry the brand.
- **Frosted glass** (`.frost`, `.btn`) uses `backdrop-filter: blur(...)` over the imagery behind it.
  The `--frost-*` tokens and `--on-img` / `--on-img-mute` (light type over imagery) are central to the look.
- **Rhythm**: `--pad-x`, `--band`, `--maxw` plus `clamp()` everywhere drive fluid sizing. Layout
  helpers: `.wrap` (horizontal padding), `.band` (vertical section padding), `.inner` (max width +
  centering). Breakpoints at 1080px, 820px, 540px.
- **Hairlines**: `--hair` / `--hair-soft` at `--hair-w` (1px).

## The hero backdrop is generated, not photographed

The hero is **not an image**. `.hero__slot` is a `<canvas>` painted by
[`scripts/herofield.ts`](web/src/scripts/herofield.ts) — **five passes, three programs**, rendered at
the display's own resolution. It replaced a 2675×1506 WebP that visibly blurred on any display wider
than its own pixel count. There is no hero image, no `site.hero.image`, and no hero preload in
`Base.astro` — do not reintroduce them.

The pipeline is: **A** field → `sceneTex` in linear HDR (alpha carries the contrast guard); **B/C**
bright-pass + separable blur at ¼; **D** second octave at ⅛; **E** composite, tonemap, grain, sRGB.

Things to know before editing it:

- **Everything accumulates in LINEAR light**, and the palette constants in the shader are already
  raised to 2.2. Never paste sRGB values into them. Accumulating in gamma space is what makes bright
  areas go chalky grey instead of hot, and it is a physical error, not a matter of taste.
- **The tonemap is a highlight-only shoulder, deliberately not ACES.** ACES desaturates and pulls
  midtones down, and the midtones here are exactly what the type contrast is measured against.
  Everything in the background ramp sits below the shoulder and passes through untouched.
- **Contrast is load-bearing.** The headline, sub-label and CTA are light type over this, under
  `.hero__veil`. `CORE` and `FOG` are set by measurement, not by eye. Because contrast is a function of
  *mean* luminance and the strands are thin, the fog wash on the base is pushed hard while the guard on
  the strands is kept light — suppressing the strands instead just empties the left of the frame.
  Current worst-case, measured across frames: sub 2.57:1, h1 4.98:1, CTA 6.33:1, statcard 2.29:1.
  `test-contrast.mjs` does **not** cover any of this — it only checks token pairs. The method is:
  inject CSS making the hero type transparent, screenshot several frames, measure the backdrop under
  each type rect with `sharp`, take the worst. The travelling pulses move light around, so a
  single-frame reading is not trustworthy.
- **Filaments are iso-lines of a warped *coordinate*, not of the noise**, and the y slope (7.0) must
  stay well above the warp amplitude (~±1.5). Comparable values put extrema through the field, and an
  extremum in a coordinate whose iso-lines you are drawing is a closed contour — it reads as wood grain.
- **Node bursts are drawn in angle space, not squeezed out of the flow.** A scalar field whose
  iso-lines radiate from a point must have a critical point there, and that critical point is a ring —
  bending the flow radially always produces a tree-knot artefact at the radius where the bend cancels
  the slope. Angle-space rays have no such constraint and stay continuous across the atan seam because
  the ray count (26) is an integer.
- **Per-strand identity is what stops it reading as a contour map.** Each strand hashes brightness (a
  cubic tail: a few hot, most faint), width and temperature off `floor(v)`.
- **Hashes are sin-free on purpose.** At ~58 hashes per pixel the transcendental version was the
  difference between holding 60fps and the ladder degrading resolution.
- **It runs off `gsap.ticker`**, which `scroll.ts` already drives in lockstep with Lenis. Do not open a
  second rAF loop; one clock is what keeps it feeling attached to the smooth scroll.
- **The canvas must never set its own transform** — `reveal.ts` scrubs `yPercent` on `.hero__slot` for
  the scroll parallax and the two would fight.
- **Fallbacks**: no WebGL2, or a lost context, drops to the CSS gradient on `.hero`, which is built
  from the same palette and is a complete design on its own. Without `EXT_color_buffer_float` the
  targets fall back to `RGBA8` with the range packed into them. Reduced motion renders exactly one
  frame (and takes `preserveDrawingBuffer`, without which that frame vanishes on the next re-raster).
- **Two perf governors.** A pixel budget (`MAX_PIXELS`, 3.0e6) caps total work — measured, because this
  shader runs ~22ms/frame at 4.2 megapixels, and a deliberate 0.85 scale beats the ladder reacting its
  way down to 0.75. On a 1× display the cap never binds. The frame-time ladder is the backstop: it only
  steps **down**, on frames over 24ms, and it ignores the first 90 frames — a load-time burst would
  otherwise permanently degrade the render. Keep 24ms clear of the 16.7ms a healthy frame takes.

## ⚠ Outstanding before launch — privacy policy

The UK GDPR privacy notice **has now been ported** into the Astro build at
[`web/src/pages/privacy.astro`](web/src/pages/privacy.astro) (live at `/privacy`), is **linked from the
footer** ([web/src/components/Footer.astro](web/src/components/Footer.astro)) and from the Booker panel's
consent line, and the contact email now reads from `site.ts`. The page is still a **draft** — these
items remain before launch:

1. **Fill the remaining `[PLACEHOLDER]` tokens**: `[COMPANY LEGAL NAME]`, `[COMPANY NUMBER — if a
   registered company]`, `[REGISTERED / POSTAL ADDRESS]`, `[RETENTION PERIOD ...]` (§6), and the
   `[DATE — set on launch]` "Last updated" value. (The `[CONTACT EMAIL]` placeholder is already
   resolved — it reads from `site.ts`.)
2. Remove the visible `.draft-note` banner and the top-of-file `TODO BEFORE LAUNCH` comment.
3. The ICO contact details (§9) are real and correct — leave them as-is.
4. The enquiry form now exists — it's the **Booker** contact panel, which POSTs to **Web3Forms** (the
   policy discloses Web3Forms + Google Workspace as processors). The lawful basis is
   legitimate-interest enquiry handling; if collection ever changes to a marketing/newsletter list, the
   basis must change to explicit consent (with an unsubscribe mechanism).

## Historical reference — the `agency-wireframe/` export

This folder is the Claude Design handoff the build came from. It is **not** the live site; keep it for
provenance and assets.

- **`project/OS - Website.html` + `os-site.css`** — the prototype the Astro build was made from
  (sections match the build). The build's [os-site.css](web/src/styles/os-site.css) is ported from here
  1:1, except the design-tool `<image-slot>` rules now target real `<img>` and the gradient placeholder
  fallbacks were dropped.
- **`project/Landing Page Wireframe.html`** — an earlier, self-contained iteration with inlined styles
  and *different* brand tokens. Superseded; reference only.
- **`project/image-slot.js`** — a Claude Design custom element (`<image-slot>`) for filling mockup
  images. **Design-tool infrastructure, not shipped** — the Astro build already replaced it with
  ordinary `<img>`. Ignore it unless you specifically need to understand the old prototype.
- **`project/assets/`** — the original PNG background/proof images. These are **no longer the live
  assets**: the shipped versions are `.webp` in [`web/src/assets/`](web/src/assets/), imported by
  `site.ts` so `astro:assets` can emit width/height and a responsive srcset at build time. Keep this
  folder as the source provenance only. (`web/public/assets/` now holds just `og.jpg`, referenced by
  `Base.astro` for the social card — everything else moved out of `public/`.) The **hero** is the
  exception: it is no longer an image at all in either place, only `project/assets/` provenance —
  see "The hero backdrop is generated" above.
- **`project/uploads/` and `project/screenshots/`** — design-process scratch (user uploads, scan/fix/v2/v3
  iteration shots). Not part of the site; ignore unless referenced.
